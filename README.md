Comprehensive event listener managing all media player states:
mediaPlayer.setEventListener { event ->
    when (event.type) {
        MediaPlayer.Event.Playing -> // Handle playing state
        MediaPlayer.Event.Paused -> // Handle pause state
        MediaPlayer.Event.Stopped -> // Handle stop state
        MediaPlayer.Event.EndReached -> // Handle end of media
        MediaPlayer.Event.EncounteredError -> // Error recovery
        MediaPlayer.Event.Buffering -> // Buffer monitoring
        MediaPlayer.Event.Vout -> // Video output management
        // ... additional events
    }
}
